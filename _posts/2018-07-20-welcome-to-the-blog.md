Hello to whomever has stumbled across my blog. I have recently decided to start documenting interesting things I create and find as I make my way through this weird yet wonderfully awesome event in spacetime we call __life__.

I hope you find what you are looking for and if not... well look elsewhere! I will attempt to blog whenever I come across something spectaculary cool and when I feel like blogging. I've always wanted to blog regularly and this time I will (well we will see).
